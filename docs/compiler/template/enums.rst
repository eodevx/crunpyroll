Available Enums
===============

This page is about Crunpyroll enumerations. Enumerations are types that hold a group of related values to be
used whenever a constant value is required. They will help you deal with those values in a type-safe way and
also enable code completion so that you can be sure to apply only a valid value among the expected ones.
